Recipes Project in The Odin Project: Foundations

At the end of this I will have demonstrated the ability to create links, show images, and general HTML structuring and layout.

After finishing up this project, I became more familiar with the html boilerplate, I also now have a much better understanding of the git workflow on my machine. I feel like some understandings clicked, though I still am pretty sloppy on my commit messages, it's really easy to forget to adhere to a standard, in fact I think I would benefit from going through some other peoples repos and seeing how everything works out in larger scale projects so I can kind of just get a better feel for when I should commit and what my messages should be.
